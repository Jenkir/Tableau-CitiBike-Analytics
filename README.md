# Tableau-CitiBike-Analytics
The premise for this assignment is that we have been hired as the new lead analysts for the New York Citi Bike Program. In our new role, we are expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to improve the program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has collected data on the program's utilization. Each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. 

Task:

The main task is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). 

I did an analysis comparing 2018 and 2019. The reason for this is that there were 2 "events" in 2019 that may have affected ridership compared to 2018.
These first was that July 2019 was, according to noaa.gov, the hottest month ever recorded on our planet. The second event was that 2019 was the deadliest 
year for bike-riding in New York City since 2000, according to numerous news articles. I wanted to show any differences between the two years for such items as average duration of ride and popularity of start and end stations. 

I also designed two dashboards for the the phenomena. However, there are no definitive reasons for the differences as shown by this data. 
Included in the visualizations is a static map that plots bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.

Finally, I created a [Tableau Story](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jennifer.duffy/viz/CitiBike-2018-2019-Analysis/basicmap) that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.
