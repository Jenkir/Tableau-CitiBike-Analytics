# Tableau-CitiBike-Analytics
The premise for this assignment is that we have been hired as the new lead analysts for the New York Citi Bike Program. In our new role, we are expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.
Since 2013, the Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Through the team's efforts, each month bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.
However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have a number of questions on the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

Task
The main task is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena.
Design 2-5 visualizations for each discovered phenomena (4-10 total). 
The following are questions that we tackled:


How many trips have been recorded total during the chosen period?


By what percentage has total ridership grown?


How has the proportion of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed?


What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during summer months?


What are the peak hours in which bikes are used during winter months?


Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?)


Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? (Based on data, why?)


Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? (Based on data, why?)


Today, what are the bottom 10 stations in the city for ending a journey (Based on data, why?)


Today, what is the gender breakdown of active participants (Male v. Female)?


How effective has gender outreach been in increasing female ridership over the timespan?


How does the average trip duration change by age?


What is the average distance in miles that a bike is ridden?




Next, we used the visualizations to design a dashboard for each phenomena.
The dashboards are accompanied with an analysis explaining why the phenomena may be occuring.

City officials also requested one of the following visualizations:


Basic: A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey with zip code data overlaid on top.


Advanced: A dynamic map that shows how each station's popularity changes over time (by month and year). Again, with zip code data overlaid on the map.


Finally, I created a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.


The final submission included:

4-10 Total "Phenomenon" Visualizations
2 Dashboards
1 City Official Map
1 Story
